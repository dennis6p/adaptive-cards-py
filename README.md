[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/adaptive-cards-py.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/adaptive-cards-py/)

A thin Python wrapper for creating [**Adaptive Cards**](https://adaptivecards.io/) easily on code level. The deep integration of Python's `typing` package alongside the famous `pydantic` library prevents you from creating invalid schemas and guides you while setting up the code for generating visually appealing cards.

If you are interested in the general concepts of adaptive cards and want to dig a bit deeper, have a look into the [**official documentation**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/) or get used to the [**schema**](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/) first.

ðŸ’¡ **Please note**
<br>This library is work in progress. Missing parts are planned to be added from time to time.

## About

This library is intended to provide a clear and simple interface for creating adaptive cards with only a few lines of code in a more robust way. The heavy usage of Python's `typing` mechanisms and the `pydantic` library should prevent one from creating invalid schemes and structures. Instead, creating and sending cards should be intuitive and supported by the typing system.

For a comprehensive introduction into the main ideas and patterns of adaptive cards, head over to the [**official documentation**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards). I also recommend using the [**schema explorer**](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer) page alongside the implementation, since the library's type system relies on these schemas.

* [__Official repository__](https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards)

ðŸ’¡ **Please note**
<br> There are size limitations related to the [__target framework__](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/resources/partners#live) (or "__Host__") a card is supposed to be used with. As of now, the maximum card size can be __28KB__ when used with Webhooks in Teams ([__Format cards in Teams__](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-format?tabs=adaptive-md%2Cdesktop%2Cdesktop1%2Cdesktop2%2Cconnector-html)). For bot frameworks the upper limit is set to __40KB__ ([__Format your bot messages__](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/format-your-bot-messages)). An corresponding check is part of the [`CardValidator`](#validate-schema).

## Features

ðŸ’¡ **Please note**
<br>It's highly recommended to turn on the **type check** capabilities for Python in your editor. This will serve you with direct feedback about the structures you create. If you are trying to assign values of incompatible types, your editor will mark it as such and yell at you right in the moment you are about to do so. Otherwise, invalid schemas can be detected by making use of the card validation, once the card has been successfully created. Cards are validated against the official schema there and possible incompatibilities can be detected.

**Key aspects**

+ Type annotated components based on `pydantic` and `typing`
+ Validation of versions, card size and schema
+ Simple `json` and `dict` export
+ Update methods for manipulating card components after creation
+ [**Passive error handling**](https://github.com/rustedpy/result) via the `result` package for validation and card updates (similar to Rust approach) 
+ Compliant with the official structures and ideas
+ Communication via `TeamsClient`

## Dependencies

* `pydantic`
* `requests`
* `jsonschema`
* `mypy`
* `result`

Works with Python 3.10+

## Installation

```bash
pip install adaptive-cards-py
```
or 
```bash
uv add adaptive-cards-py
```

## Library structure

**Adaptive cards** can consist of different kinds of components. The four main categories beside the actual cards are **Elements**, **Containers**, **Actions** and **Inputs**. You can find all available components for each category within the corresponding module. The `AdaptiveCard` is defined in the `cards` module.

In addition to that, some fields of certain components are of custom types. These types are living inside the `card_types` module. For instance, if you are about to assign a color to a `TextBlock`, the field `color` will only accept a value of type `Colors`, which is implemented in the aforementioned Python file.

To perform validation on a fully initialized card, one can make use of the `CardValidator` class (`validation` module). Similar to the whole library, this class provides a simple interface. For creating a validator, a factory (`CardValidatorFactory`) can be used, in order to account for the desired target framework. Validation will check the following points:


* Are any components used, which are not yet available for the card version?
* Is the card size within the limitation defined by the target framework?
* Does the schema correspond to the official card schema?
* Are there any components in the card body at all?

## Usage

### Create a card

#### A simple card

A simple `TextBlock` lives in the `elements` module and can be used after it's import.

```Python
from adaptive_cards.elements import TextBlock

text_block: TextBlock = TextBlock(text="It's your first card")
```
For this component, `text` is the only required property. However, if more customization is needed, further available fields can be used.

```Python
from adaptive_cards.elements import TextBlock
import adaptive_cards.card_types as types

text_block: TextBlock = TextBlock(
    text="It's your second card",
    color=types.Colors.ACCENT,
    size=types.FontSize.EXTRA_LARGE,
    horizontal_alignment=types.HorizontalAlignment.CENTER,
)
```

An actual card with only this component can be created like this.

```Python
from adaptive_cards.card import AdaptiveCard

...

version: str = "1.4"
card: AdaptiveCard = AdaptiveCard.new() \
                                 .version(version) \
                                 .add_item(text_block) \
                                 .create()
```

Find your final layout below.

![simple card](https://github.com/dennis6p/adaptive-cards-py/blob/main/examples/simple_card/simple_card.jpg?raw=true)

ðŸ’¡ **Please note**
<br>After building the object is done, the `create(...)` method must be called in order to construct the final object. In this case, the object will be of type `AdaptiveCard`.

To directly export your result, make use of the
`to_json()` method provided by every card.

```Python
with open("path/to/out/file.json", "w+") as f:
    f.write(card.to_json())

```

Assuming you have a bunch of components you want your card to enrich with. There is also a method for doing so. Let's re-use the example from before, but add another `Image` component here as well.

```Python
from adaptive_cards.elements import TextBlock, Image
import adaptive_cards.card_types as types

text_block: TextBlock = TextBlock(
    text="It's your third card",
    color=types.Colors.ACCENT,
    size=types.FontSize.EXTRA_LARGE,
    horizontal_alignment=types.HorizontalAlignment.CENTER,
)

image: Image = Image(url="https://adaptivecards.io/content/bf-logo.png")

version: str = "1.4"
card: AdaptiveCard = AdaptiveCard.new() \
                                 .version(version) \
                                 .add_items([text_block, image]) \
                                 .create()

# Alternatively, you can also chain multiple add_item(...) functions:
# card = AdaptiveCard.new() \
#                    .version(version) \
#                    .add_item(text_block) \
#                    .add_item(image) \
#                    .create()


with open("path/to/out/file.json", "w+") as f:
    f.write(card.to_json())
```

This will result in a card like shown below.

#### A more complex card

You can have a look on the following example for getting an idea of what's actually possible with adaptive cards.

### Update card components

Updating components and their fields can be done in-place via the `update_item(...)`/`update_action(...)` methods executed on a card object. Please note, that this is only possible for components which got assigned a proper `id` and have been part of the **initial** card setup. IDs for components added to the layout via the update method are not tracked. Hence, updating these components won't have any effect!

```python
import adaptive_cards.card_types as types
from adaptive_cards.actions import ActionOpenUrl
from adaptive_cards.card import AdaptiveCard
from adaptive_cards.elements import TextBlock

text_block: TextBlock = TextBlock(
    id="text-id",
    text="Initial text",
)

action_open_url: ActionOpenUrl = ActionOpenUrl(
    id="action-id", url="any-url", title="title"
)

# build card
version: str = "1.4"
card: AdaptiveCard = AdaptiveCard.new().add_item(text_block).create()

# update card
card.update_item(
    id="text-id",
    text="New text",
    horizontal_alignment=types.HorizontalAlignment.CENTER,
)
card.update_action(id="action-id", url="new-url")
```

Updates will **only succeed** if the following three conditions are fulfilled:
- ID of an component has been set when the card was created initially
- The property about to be updated must be part of the actual data model of the parent component
- The property's type must match the defined type in the parent data model

Properties do not need to be set initially to be updated via the above described steps.

### Validate a card

New components and properties are getting introduced every now and then. This means, if you are using an early version for a card and add properties, which are not compliant with it, you will have an invalid schema. To prevent you from exporting properties not yet supported by the card and target framework, a card validation can be performed for the expected [__target framework__](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/resources/partners#live) (see [__Library structure__](#library-structure) for more info). For MS Teams as the target framework, it would look like this:

```python
from adaptive_cards.card import AdaptiveCard
from adaptive_cards.validation import (
    CardValidatorFactory, 
    CardValidator,
    Finding
)
from result import Result, Err, Ok, is_ok

...

version: str = "1.4"
card: AdaptiveCard = AdaptiveCard.new() \
                                 .version(version) \
                                 .add_items([text_block, image]) \
                                 .create()

# generate a validator object for your required target framework
validator: CardValidator = CardValidatorFactory.create_validator_microsoft_teams()
result: Result[None, str] = validator.validate(card)

print(f"Validation was successful: {is_ok(result)}")

# As it might come in handy in some situations, there is a separate class method
# which can be utilized to calculate the card size without running the full
# validation procedure
card_size: float = validator.card_size(card)
print(card_size)

# in case the validation failed, you can check the validation details by using the according method, 
# to get a full list of all findings occurred during validation.
details: list[Finding] = validator.details()

# please note, that the validation details are stored within the validator and will be overwritten,
# once a new validator.validation(card) execution is done with the same validator object. 

```

### Send card to MS Teams

Of course, you want to create those cards for a reason. So once you did that, you might want to send it to one of the compatible services like MS Teams. See the following example, how this can be done, assuming that all previously mentioned steps are done prior to that:

```python

...

from adaptive_cards.clients import TeamsClient
from requests import Response

...

# send card
webhook_url: str = "YOUR-URL"
client: TeamsClient = TeamsClient(webhook_url)
response: Response = client.send(card)

new_webhook_url: str = "YOUR-URL-OF-SECOND-CHANNEL"
client.set_webhook_url(new_webhook_url)
response: Response = client.send(card)

...

```

So far, there is only a MS Teams client available. If further services should be supported, give me some feedback by opening an Issue for instance.
